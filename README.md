# DuckyScript
The DuckyScript language is a script language used to automate tasks on a computer. It was specifically designed for use with the USB Rubber Ducky, a device that can mimic the functions of a keyboard and execute pre-programmed scripts.

# Instructions
1. First, make sure you have a USB Rubber Ducky and the necessary software installed on your computer. You can find instructions for setting up the USB Rubber Ducky on the official website.

2. Next, browse to the Github repository containing the DuckyScripts you want to use. You can find repositories by searching for keywords related to your desired task, or by browsing through popular repositories in the DuckyScript language.

3. Once you have found a repository with the scripts you want to use, you can download the scripts by clicking on the "Clone or download" button and selecting "Download ZIP." This will download a zip file containing all the scripts in the repository.

4. Extract the zip file to a location on your computer. This will create a folder containing all the scripts in the repository.

5. Open the script you want to use in a text editor, and make any necessary modifications to the script. For example, you may need to change the script to launch a specific application or enter specific data.

6. Once you have finished modifying the script, save it to your computer.

7. Use the software provided with the USB Rubber Ducky to convert the script into a binary file that can be executed on the device. You can find instructions for this process in the documentation provided with the software.

8. Plug the USB Rubber Ducky into a computer and run the binary file to execute the script. The USB Rubber Ducky will mimic the functions of a keyboard and execute the script as if it were being typed by a human.

Remember to use caution when running scripts from unfamiliar sources, as they may potentially harm your computer or data. It is always a good idea to carefully review and test scripts before using them.
